-serialization problem ?
-null pointer exception while refreshing editView
-filter on table (foreignField and set)
-many to one relationship
-CRUDTable - to large Class
-selection vs closing window (possible memory leak)
-hibernate exceptions (constraints, deleted rows)
-refreshing combobox list after selecting/changing list values
-catching all exceptions (?)
-logger

consider:
-Hibernate does "delete all then re-insert" - its not so strange - Bag for Association
