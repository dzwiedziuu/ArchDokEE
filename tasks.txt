-serialization problem ?
-CRUDTable - to large Class
-visible, big tittle in every view
-login & logout
-reports
-themes
-validation
-rest of domain
-check out commit()
-image upload
-check out what with detail field?
-change controller to prototype
-change mechanism of topbar - not refreshed after close
-get new object from db at edit
-check if from dict are only objects from business context (are?)

consider:
-Hibernate does "delete all then re-insert" - its not so strange - Bag for Association
-page in one view?
-merge (in onetoMany relation) generates too many selects
-displaying date in table
-null pointer exception while refreshing editView
