-serialization problem ?
-null pointer exception while refreshing editView
-filter on table - actionField (foreignField and set)
-many to one relationship
-CRUDTable - to large Class
-hibernate exceptions (constraints, deleted rows)
-log some exceptions
-removing dependent objects

consider:
-Hibernate does "delete all then re-insert" - its not so strange - Bag for Association
