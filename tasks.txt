-serialization problem ?
-null pointer exception while refreshing editView
-filter on table (foreignField and others probably)
-many to many relationship
-display manyTo* in table
-CRUDTable - to large Class
-selection vs closing window
-hibernate exceptions (constraints, deleted rows)
-refreshing combobox list after selecting/changing list values

consider:
-Hibernate does "delete all then re-insert" - its not so strange - Bag for Association
